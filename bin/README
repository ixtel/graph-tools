The approach of having gist folders and symlinks does have an
overhead:

$ time geng -qc 7 | moore.py
FCp`_
F~~~w

real	0m1.457s
user	0m0.532s
sys	0m0.096s
matthew@asa:~$ time geng -qc 7 | ~/workspace/graphs/graph-tools/bin/moore-py/moore.py
FCp`_
F~~~w

real	0m0.844s
user	0m0.496s
sys	0m0.116s

For the consistency of the graph-tools project it doesn't make sense to have a
symbolic link either. So for now we will just have to manually keep the two
versions up-to-date.
